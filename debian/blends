Pkg-Description: analysis and visualization of functional brain imaging data
 FreeSurfer is a set of tools for analysis and visualization of
 structural and functional brain imaging data. It contains a fully
 automatic structural stream for processing cross sectional and
 longitudinal data.
 .
 FreeSurfer provides many anatomical analysis tools, including:
 representation of the cortical surface between white and gray matter,
 representation of the pial surface, segmentation of white matter from
 the rest of the brain, skull stripping, B1 bias field correction,
 nonlinear registration of the cortical surface of an individual with
 an sterotaxic atlas, labeling of regions of the cortical surface,
 statistical analysis of group morphometry differences, and labeling of
 subcortical brain structures, etc.
