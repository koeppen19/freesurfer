General issues
--------------

* freeview core-dumps upon exit
* What do we do about the license file issue? Do we ship one? Do we patch it
  away? Do we change the location to /etc/freesurfer/license? Do we make the
  package acquire a license upon first install?
* Do we want to have a git-style wrapper for the FS commandline tools, ala:

  $ freesurfer-5.1 mri_convert ....
* Missing file issue when running qdec
  attempt to provide package BLT 2.4 failed: no version of package BLT provided
  FsgdfPlot::InitFsgdf:  Couldn't find fsgdfPlot.tcl
* orient_mri issue upon exit
  *** glibc detected *** orient_mri.bin: corrupted double-linked list: 0x09131580 ***
  <backtrace>
  Abort (core dumped)
